## Domain model

The platform is built around 3 main entities: **users**, **things** and **channels**.

`User` represents the real (human) user of the system. It is represented via its
e-mail and password, which he uses as platform access credentials in order to obtain
an access token. Once logged into the system, user can manage his resources (i.e.
things and channels) in CRUD fashion, and define access control policies by
connecting them.

`Thing` represents devices (or applications) connected to Mainflux that uses the
platform for message exchange with other "things".

`Channel` represents a communication channel. It serves as message topic that
can be consumed by all of the things connected to it.

## Messaging

Mainflux uses [NATS](https://nats.io) as its messaging backbone, due to its
lightweight and performant nature. You can treat its *subjects* as physical
representation of Mainflux channels, where subject name is constructed using
channel unique identifier.

In general, there is no constrained put on content that is being exchanged
through channels. However, in order to be post-processed and normalized,
messages should be formatted using [SenML](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-senml-08).
